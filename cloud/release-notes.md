## Overview

Astronomer is committed to continuous delivery of both features and bug fixes to Astronomer Cloud. To keep your team up to date on what's new, this document will provide a regular summary of all changes officially released to Astronomer Cloud.

If you have any questions or a bug to report, don't hesitate to reach out to [Astronomer Support](https://support.astronomer.io).

**Latest Runtime Version**: 4.0.6 ([Release notes](runtime-release-notes.md))

**Latest CLI Version**: 1.0.4 ([Release notes](cli-release-notes.md))

## December 9, 2021

### Additional Improvements

- In the Astronomer Cloud UI, the **Open Airflow** button now shows more specific status messages when a Deployment's Airflow UI is inaccessible.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed Deployment table scrolling and alignment issues in the UI

## December 6, 2021

### New "Usage" Tab in the Astronomer UI

Total task volume for your Organization is now available in a new **Usage** tab in the Astronomer Cloud UI. Astronomer Cloud is priced based on successful task runs, so this view can help you monitor both Astronomer cost as well as Airflow usage in aggregate and between Deployments.

For more information about the **Usage** tab, read [Deployment Metrics](deployment-metrics.md#usage).

### New AWS Regions Available

You can now create new Clusters in:

- `us-west-1`
- `ap-northeast-1 `
- `ap-southeast-1`
- `ap-northeast-2`
- `ap-southeast-2`
- `ap-south-1`
- `us-west-1`
- `us-west-2`

For a full list of AWS regions supported on Astronomer Cloud, see [AWS Resource Reference](https://docs.astronomer.io/resource-reference-aws.md#aws-region).

### Additional Improvements

- You can now see your Deployment's **Namespace** in the **Deployments** menu and on the Deployment information screen in the Astronomer UI. Namespace is a required argument to run tasks with the KubernetesPodOperator. It is also required to submit an issue to [Astronomer Support](https://support.astronomer.io).

    ![Deployment namespace available on a Deployment's information page](/img/docs/namespace.png)

- The Astronomer UI now shows a warning if you attempt to exit Environment Variable configuration without saving your changes.
- A Deployment's health status is now based on the health of both the Airflow Webserver and Scheduler. Previously, a Deployment's health status was only based on the health of the Webserver. Now, the Astronomer UI will show that your Deployment is "Healthy" only if both components are running as expected.

### Bug Fixes

- The Astronomer UI now has error handling for attempts to access a Deployment that does not exist.
- If you attempt to modify an existing secret environment variable, the **Value** field is now blank instead of showing hidden characters.

### Data Plane Improvements

- Amazon EBS volumes have been upgraded from gp2 to [gp3](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/introducing-new-amazon-ebs-general-purpose-volumes-gp3/) for improved scale and performance.
- EBS volumes and S3 buckets are now encrypted by default.
- The ability to enable public access to any Amazon S3 bucket on an Astronomer Cloud data plane is now blocked. Previously, public access was disabled by default but could be overriden by AWS account owners.

## November 19, 2021

### Secret Environment Variables

You can now set secret environment variables via the Astronomer Cloud UI. The values of secret environment variables are hidden from all users in your Workspace, making them ideal for storing sensitive information related to your Astronomer projects.

For more information, read [Set Environment Variables via the Astronomer UI](environment-variables.md#set-environment-variables-via-the-astronomer-ui).

### Additional Improvements

- You can now create new Clusters in AWS `sa-east-1`.
- Extra whitespace at the end of any environment variable that is set via the Astronomer UI is now automatically removed to ensure the variable is passed correctly.

## November 11, 2021

### Deployment Metrics Dashboard

In the Astronomer UI, your Deployment pages now show high-level metrics for Deployment health and performance over the past 24 hours.

<div class="text--center">

## November 5, 2021

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where a new user could not exit the Astronomer UI "Welcome" screen if they hadn't yet been invited to a Workspace

## October 29, 2021

### Astronomer UI Redesign

The Astronomer UI has been redesigned so that you can more intuitively manage Organizations, Workspaces, and your user profile.

To start, the homepage is now a global view. From here, you can now see all Workspaces that you have access to, as well as information and settings related to your **Organization**: a collection of specific users, teams, and Workspaces. Many features related to Organizations are coming soon, but the UI now better represents how Organizations are structured and what you can do with them in the future:

<div class="text--center">
  <img src="/img/docs/ui-release-note1.png" alt="New global menu in the UI" />
</div>

You can now also select specific Workspaces to work in. When you click in to a Workspace, you'll notice the lefthand menu bar is now entirely dedicated to Workspace actions:

- The Rocket icon brings you to the **Deployments** menu.
- The People icon brings you to the **Workspace Access** menu.
- The Gear icon brings you to the **Workspace Settings** menu.

To return to the global menu, you can either click the Astronomer "A" or click the Workspace name to produce a dropdown menu with your Organization.

<div class="text--center">
  <img src="/img/docs/ui-release-note2.png" alt="New Workspace menu in the UI" />
</div>

All user configurations can be found by clicking your user profile picture in the upper righthand corner of the UI. From the dropdown menu that appears, you can both configure user settings and access other Astronomer resources such as documentation and the Astronomer Registry.

<div class="text--center">
  <img src="/img/docs/ui-release-note3.png" alt="New profile menu in the UI" />
</div>

### Additional Improvements

- You can now create new Clusters in `us-east-2` and `ca-central-1`.
- In the Deployment detail page, **Astronomer Runtime** now shows the version of Apache Airflow that the Deployment's Astronomer Runtime version is based on.
- You can now create or modify an existing Astronomer Cluster to run any size of the `t2`,`t3`, `m5`, or `m5d` [AWS EC2 instances](resource-reference-aws.md).

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where a new Deployment's health status did not update unless you refreshed the Cloud UI

## October 28, 2021

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where you couldn't push code to Astronomer with a Deployment API Key via a CI/CD process
- Fixed an issue where you couldn't update or delete an API key after creating it

## October 25, 2021

### Additional Improvements

- When deleting a Deployment via the UI, you now have to type the name of the Deployment in order to confirm its deletion.

### Bug Fixes

- When creating a new Deployment in the Astronomer UI, the cluster is pre-selected if there is only one cluster available.
- The name of your Astronomer Deployment now appears on the main DAGs view of the Airflow UI.
- You can now see the health status for each Deployment in your Workspace on the table view of the **Deployments** page in the Astronomer UI:

   <div class="text--center">
     <img src="/img/docs/health-status-table.png" alt="Deployment Health statuses visible in the Deployments table view" />
   </div>

- In the Astronomer UI, you can now access the Airflow UI for Deployments via the **Deployments** page's card view:

    <div class="text--center">
      <img src="/img/docs/open-airflow-card.png" alt="Open Airflow button in the Deployments page card view" />
    </div>

- The Astronomer UI now saves your color mode preference.

## October 1, 2021

### Additional Improvements

- In the Astronomer UI, the **Open Airflow** button is now disabled until the Airflow UI of the Deployment is available.
- Workspace Admins can now edit user permissions and remove users within a given Workspace.

## September 28, 2021

:::danger

This release introduces a breaking change to code deploys via the Astronomer CLI. Starting on September 28, you must upgrade to v1.0.0 of the CLI to deploy code to Astronomer. [CI/CD processes](ci-cd.md) enabled by Deployment API keys will continue to work and will not be affected. For more information, read the [CLI release notes](cli-release-notes.md).

:::

### Additional Improvements

- In the Astronomer UI, a new element on the Deployment information screen shows the health status of a Deployment. Currently, a Deployment is considered unhealthy if the Airflow Webserver is not running and the Airflow UI is not available:

    <div class="text--center">
      <img src="/img/docs/deployment-health.png" alt="Deployment Health text in the UI" />
    </div>

- The documentation home for Astronomer Cloud has been moved to `docs.astronomer.io`, and you no longer need a password to access the page.

### Bug Fixes

## September 17, 2021

### Support for Deployment API Keys

Astronomer Cloud now officially supports Deployment API keys, which you can use to automate code pushes to Astronomer and integrate your environment with a CI/CD tool such as GitHub Actions. For more information on creating and managing Deployment API keys, see [Deployment API keys](api-keys.md). For more information on using Deployment API keys to programmatically deploy code, see [CI/CD](ci-cd.md). Support making requests to Airflow's REST API using API keys is coming soon.

## September 3, 2021
